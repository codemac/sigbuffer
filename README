#+title: sigbuffer: buffer stderr/stdout between signals

This tool is for folks who use dumb terminals along with tools like
dtach/abduco. When you detach from the session, the idea is it would
start buffering the output into memory until you reattached
later. Currently this is only partially functional, as some tooling is
necessary to get the USR1/USR2 detach/reattach session management
working.

* Build instructions

Will be moving to [[https://gittup.org/tup][tup]] when there is more to build, but for now:

gcc '-std=c11' ./sigbuffer.c

And then run with ./a.out

* Use instructions

None yet, as the USR1/USR2 doesn't work yet.
